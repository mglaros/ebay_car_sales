# ebay_car_sales

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from *eBay Kleinanzeigen*, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). 

The **aim** of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.
